This is a small program written in C that converts your name to ASCII and Binary.
I have tested this program on windows.
HOW TO USE
When you run this program you will be prompted to enter your name (Your can enter any word or sentence in english).
When you hit enter it will convert your name to ASCII and binary.
I have programmed it in a way that it does not converts white space between the words, instead it replaces the white space with two white spaces to make the ASCII and binary more readable.
